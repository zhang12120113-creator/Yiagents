"""LangChain ``@tool`` wrapper for the Eastmoney A-share data vendor.

A thin pass-through to ``route_to_vendor`` — same shape as the SEC ownership
tool module — so the optional-category fallback (429/network/non-A-share ->
sentinel) is reused verbatim. Only the fundamentals analyst advertises this,
and only when ``YIAGENTS_A_STOCK`` is on **and** ``is_a_stock(ticker)`` holds;
the fundamentals ``ToolNode`` carries it too so dispatched tool_calls resolve,
but for a default run (or any non-A-share ticker) the LLM never names it so it
stays dormant.

* ``get_margin_trading`` — 融资融券 (margin trading: 融资余额 / 融券余额 /
  融资买入额 / 融资净买入额). China A-share only; a non-A-share ticker degrades
  to the ``NO_DATA_AVAILABLE`` sentinel.

Point-in-time correct (rows filtered by ``date <= curr_date``) so it is safe to
use in backtests.
